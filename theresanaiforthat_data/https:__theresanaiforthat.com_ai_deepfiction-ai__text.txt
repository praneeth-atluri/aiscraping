The stories are very short and the app barely gives you any free credits. If you aren't going to pay for it don't even bother.

So, Deep Fiction AI is not perfect, by any means, but its Lustix add-on makes it superior to NSFW AIs. Your prompts have to be detailed and as specific as possible if you want Deep Fiction AI to craft a scene to your liking. It writes the scenes for you, but you are the director in charge. You have to guide it.
I don't know why the comments below me have such issues with it when I think Deep Fiction AI is the best one I've used. It's better than ChatGPT, which just churns out cliche and cheesy storytelling. You have to keep reminding ChatGPT of certain things otherwise it just assumes BS on its own. Deep Fiction AI, on the other hand, is capable of inspiration and creativity. It will fill in narrative gaps on its own, such as dialogue. ChatGPT will not do this unless you direct it too, and sometimes it will not even insert dialogue.
While I'm not happy about the credit-based feature, I understand why it's there. This is a tool that surpasses most AI writing generators on the market right now. You're also not forced to subscribe to use it, so you can always just pay up front to get as many credits as you want and use it until your credits run out.

It was a very moving story, but absolutely nothing what I asked for. The main character wasn't even close to my main character. The picture however, did depict the characters in their setting.
