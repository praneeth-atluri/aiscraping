Generated by ChatGPT
Sqlephant is an AI-powered SQL development companion that offers various features to simplify and enhance the process of SQL development. It provides swift schema generation with automated type inference, allowing users to easily generate SQL schemas by specifying the names of the SQL columns.  The tool also offers SQL requests fixer and SQL injections fixer, helping to identify and rectify bugs and vulnerabilities in SQL statements.In addition, Sqlephant offers comprehensive SQL wrapper generation for multiple programming languages such as C#, Java, PHP, and Python.  Users can simply drop a SQL query into the editor, and Sqlephant will generate a fully prepared wrapper with clean DTO mapping.Furthermore, the tool enables CRUD generation, allowing users to generate ready-to-use Create, Read, Update, and Delete functions for a selected SQL table.  Matching DTOs are also created automatically.Sqlephant plans to introduce web app generation in the near future, which will allow users to generate user-friendly web applications with clear, comprehensible code, including elements such as Data Transfer Object (DTO), Data Access Object (DAO), Web Class, HTML page, and CSS code.  The platform ensures full transparency, providing straightforward access to all elements for easy maintenance.Privacy and security are prioritized, as Sqlephant operates solely on metadata and ensures that corporate data is never used.  All requests are discarded once completed, guaranteeing confidentiality.To get started with Sqlephant, users need to download the tool, sign up for a free account, and import their text schema to start generating various types of code.  The tool supports Windows, macOS, and Linux, and no admin/root privileges are required for installation.
