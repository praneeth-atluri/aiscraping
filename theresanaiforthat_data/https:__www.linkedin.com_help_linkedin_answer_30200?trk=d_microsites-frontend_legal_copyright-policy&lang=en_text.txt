If you find inaccurate information on another member’s profile, you can report it by completing the form to report inaccurate information on a member's profile. At this time, the information you can report is limited to employment and education experience only.


      To report profiles with inaccurate information, you can file a formal complaint. You’ll be asked to provide the following information:
    




      Link to the inaccurate account or content
    





      The name of the school, university, or company that is inaccurate on the profile being reported
    





      Explanation of how you know this account or other information is inaccurate or false
    





      Your digital signature
    




After you've completed the form, it will automatically be sent to our Trust and Safety team for review. You can save a copy for your reference. We will notify the alleged infringer that the content will be removed within fourteen (14) days, unless we receive a valid Counter-Notice. If a valid Counter-Notice form is submitted, we'll let you know. 


      If you believe a claim about your content was submitted in error or if you want to contest the removal of the allegedly infringing, inaccurate, or unlawful content, you may submit a Counter Notice. Any assertions made by you in submitting a Counter Notice are under penalty of perjury.
