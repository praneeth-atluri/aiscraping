Forget PowerPoint and Google Slides!

Here's a new way to present ideas that's faster and more flexible...


Where every second counts, the idea of converting raw text into polished content with minimal effort isn't just appealing‚Äîit's needed.

And that's exactly where Gamma shines.

ü¶æ https://t.ly/gamma

Think about the countless hours spent on aligning text boxes, choosing fonts, or browsing for the perfect image.

Gamma streamlines this entire process!

Here's how to use it:

1. Get started

From your dashboard, click ‚ÄòCreate with AI‚Äô. Then, choose ‚ÄòGenerate‚Äô, select presentation, enter your prompt and click ‚ÄòGenerate outline‚Äò.

2. Draft your content

Gamma will automatically create an outline you can easily customize to your liking. Edit or delete slides, text length, and add images.

3. Select a theme

Choose from more than 15 different themes to create your perfectly designed presentation. Pick your favorite and click ‚ÄòGenerate‚Äô.

4. View your presentation

You're all done! But, if you want to change your presentation, it can easily be done with AI.

5. Edit with AI

Click the ‚ÄòAI‚Äô icon in the toolbar on the right side of your presentation. Type what you want the AI to do and hit ‚ÄòEnter‚Äô.


That's all there is to it!
