Makes my job easier!


I have been using this product for a few years now and always fine the support the best in the business. Great product and support makes my job easier!

Thanks.

Support is great.


Great plugin. Found a small bug, reported it, and it was fixed right away. Support is great. It's nice to see other WooCommerce plugins out there offering the features that WooCommerce themselves do not. Often consumers don't want to trust other developers/engineers but I would recommend this plugin.


Dana Cottreau












Easy to configure!!!


After a lot of research and testing Smart Coupons Pro plugin was exactly what I wanted. Easy to configure and the only plugin that allows me to control coupons triggered by quantity in the way I needed. I could not be happier with WebToffee and their excellent and fast support.
