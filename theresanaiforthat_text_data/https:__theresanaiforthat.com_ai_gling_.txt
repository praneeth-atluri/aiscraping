Generated by ChatGPT
Gling is an AI-powered video editing tool designed to help YouTube creators save time and improve their workflow. Using machine learning algorithms, Gling automatically recognises and cuts silences, bad takes and disfluencies from the raw upload.  This can all be done in a few minutes and the resulting edit can be exported as an XML timeline to various professional video editors or as an mp4 to any editor.  Additionally, Gling offers a free editing of the first video and a $5 charge for every video edited afterwards. Currently, Gling only supports English videos, but the creators are hoping to expand to other languages soon.  Gling is easy to use and helps creators save time and effort without compromising on quality.
