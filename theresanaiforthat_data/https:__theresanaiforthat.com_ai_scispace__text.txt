I've tried to find the exact articles via WoS, Google, or Scopus. Despite using a very advised and complicated search query, it was just a waste of time. Perplexity didn't help either. The Jenni AI, which may add useful links when generating text, finds nothing but trash. SciScape gave exactly what I needed from the first query! A couple of fresh relative articles with very exact topics!

OK, so the good news is that I found this a few months ago, and it is a tool I use probably 30 to 50 times a day, whether it be the Chrome browser, the AI detector, or the rephrasing my text in an academic style and then tested on the AI detector. I don't know how this is still free, but I'm Telling you that you better try it quickly before it does, as elicit.Org, PaperDigest,
