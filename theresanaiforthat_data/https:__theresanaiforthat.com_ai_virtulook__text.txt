This dude is a freakin' dope scammer, and a hella copycat monster! Go check out the interfaces of weshop and ZMO, they're like the Frankenstein of apps! Oh, and RoomPhoto was shamelessly ripped off too! Their sugar daddy, Wanxing, has produced a ton of knockoff apps with service quality that's straight-up garbage!
