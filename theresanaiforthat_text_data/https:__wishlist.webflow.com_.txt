        Best Practices for Storing Sensitive Data: Securing API Tokens in .env Files
        

      

          I need to directly hide my external API token data without third party integration, but there doesn't seem to be a solution. Therefore, I need to store my sensitive data in a secure file, such as a .env file.

          It would be awesome to have a dynamic slider component with the ability to filter the number of slides, ordering them, etc.

          When I add a css class and then add another css class on top of it, the resulting css rule in the code is a compound rule. Most of the time this is fine, but there are times I need the two rules to be separate. Please expand on the css layering, b...

        Custom note/message in order fulfillment email
        

      

          I'd like to be able to add a note to the customer inside the fulfillment email. Being able to say "thanks" would be a nice personal touch, but I sometimes want to include other info about shipping. And some orders use two tracking numbers.
