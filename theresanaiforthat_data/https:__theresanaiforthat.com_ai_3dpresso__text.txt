Generated by ChatGPT
3Dpresso is a web-based platform that allows creators to extract 3D models by capturing a 1-2 minute video of an object and uploading it to the platform.  The AI technology then extracts a 3D model of the object which can be viewed on the ‚ÄúMy Models‚Äù page and downloaded in *.glb format. The platform also features an AI Texture function that applies multiple textures to a single model to create unique variations.  Creators can change the texture of the 3D model by using text via generative AI prompts. The 3Dpresso capturing app, though optional, is recommended as it is more user-friendly, intuitive and powerful, allowing creators to capture more lifelike 3D models with ease.  Users can access video capturing guide, FAQ, and creator tutorials on the platform. There is also a Discord community where creators can connect and chat with others, share their thoughts, ideas, and experiences.  The service is provided by RECON Labs, and models of commercial products must never be used to manufacture the products themselves under any circumstances.  The platform sends an email notification when the 3D model is available for download, which normally takes 30 minutes, depending on the video quality.  Overall, 3Dpresso offers a convenient and accessible solution for creating 3D content using AI technology, without requiring advanced technical skills.
