Taskbase offers a platform to provide personal and executive assistant services which are supported by AI technologies. Taskbase is designed to help entrepreneurs, small business owners, and busy professionals reduce stress and increase productivity by saving time usually spent on administrative activities.  The company assigns a dedicated assistant to each user, capable of carrying out a wide range of tasks, from diary management to event planning, invoicing, finance, market research, email management, and data cleaning.  Taskbase assistants are selected from the top percentiles of applicants, which ensures their expertise and ability to handle different tasks.
