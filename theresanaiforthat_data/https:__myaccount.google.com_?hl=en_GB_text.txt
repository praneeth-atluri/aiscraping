All of Google, working for you
Sign in to your Google Account, and get the most out of all the Google services that you use. Your account helps you do more by personalising your Google experience and offering easy access to your most important information from anywhere.









Helps you
When you’re signed in, all of the Google services that you use work together seamlessly to offer help with everyday tasks like syncing your Gmail with your Google Calendar and Google Maps to make sure that you’re always on top of your schedule.


Built for you
No matter which device or Google service you’re using, your account gives you a consistent experience that you can customise and manage at any time.


Protects you
Your Google Account is protected by industry-leading security that automatically helps detect and block threats before they ever reach you.






Ready to help

Your Google Account helps you save time by automatically filling in passwords, addresses and payment details using the information that you’ve saved to your account.


When you sign in to your Google Account, all the Google services that you use work together to help you get more done. For example, flight confirmations in your Gmail inbox will automatically sync with your Google Calendar and Google Maps to help you get to the airport on time.


From resuming YouTube videos across devices, to having your contacts and favourite Play Store apps easily available, a single sign-in allows for a seamless experience across Google. Your Google Account also makes it easy for you to sign in to third-party apps safely and quickly so that your preferences go with you even beyond Google.


























Just for you

A safe place for your info

When it comes to privacy, we know that one size doesn’t fit all. That’s why every Google Account comes with easy-to-use controls and tools like Privacy Check-Up, so that you can choose the privacy settings that are right for you. You can also control what data is saved in your account with easy on/off controls, and even delete your data by date, product and topic.


Your Google Account gives you a safe, central place to store your personal information — like credit cards, passwords and contacts — so that it’s always available for you across the Internet when you need it.


























Keeping your information private, safe and secure
