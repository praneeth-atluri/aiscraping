Generated by ChatGPT
Meshy is a 3D generative AI production suite that offers AI modeling and texturing tools to speed up the creation of 3D game assets. With Meshy, artists and creators can generate high-poly 3D models using text prompts or 2D concept art via the AI texturing tool.  The AI modeling tool allows artists to craft 3D models directly from reference images or text prompts without the need for 3D sculpting or scanning tools.  One of Meshy's newest features is text to 3D, a tool that enables non-3D experienced creators to generate 3D models using only text input, with the entire process taking only two minutes.  Meshy's AI-native tools aim to revolutionize 3D content creation by providing a lightning-fast alternative to traditional modeling and texturing methods.  Users can generate textures in three easy steps using the AI texturing tool; they need to join the Discord channel, type "/skin" in the "text-to-texture" channel, upload their model, and write anything they imagine in the prompt box.  The AI will then automatically texture the model in less than three minutes. Similarly, users can generate 3D models in three easy steps using the text to 3D tool.  Meshy's goal is to automate the entire 3D production pipeline with generative AI. The platform is built by a small team of 3D artists, designers, and developers distributed globally and aims to help game developers and creative professionals accelerate their 3D content creation with the power of AI.
